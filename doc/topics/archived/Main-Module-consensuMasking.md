# Main: Module consensuMasking

```Bash
    cat lowcoverage_masked.fa consensus.fa >tmp_consensus.fa
    mafft --auto --inputorder --quiet tmp_consensus.fa > tmp_consensus_aln.fa
    get_N.py tmp_consensus_aln.fa
    mv output_consensus_masked.fa consensus_masked.fa
```

The above commands aim to combine information about low coverage regions obtained in [Module lowCov](Main-Module-lowCov.md) with information about mutations identified by the [varScan](Main-Module-varScan.md), [FreeBayes](Main-Module-freeBayes.md) and [Lofreq](Main-Module-lofreq.md) programs. To achieve this, we align the sequences present in the files `lowcoverage_masked.fa` and `consensus.fa`, ` using the MAFFT program. Then, a simple script combines information about low coverage regions and mutations according to a straightforward logic.
1. If a low coverage region aligns with a region where no deletion was identified, the final sequence at that position is also masked.
2. If the low coverage sequence is not masked at a given position, we enter positions as in the sequence generated by the varscan program.

Finally, from the resulting sequence, we remove the deletion symbol and obtain the final sample genome sequence, which is found in the file `consensus_masked.fa`.
